# Obfuscating
This is a Reverse Engeneering task. I get it from 'team of hackers' :) They wanted to hire me. How we can secretly hidden any text(or executable code) into excutable module, for example: 'Hello world'? Noone can't see this text by hex editor or debugger during view of our module. Main condition - we need use this text as usual text into our project! Use magic C++11 word - constexpr
